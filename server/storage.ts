        excerpt: 'Learn best practices for designing, implementing, and maintaining RESTful APIs that are scalable, secure, and developer-friendly.',
        content: `# Building Robust APIs: A Developer's Guide

APIs are the backbone of modern applications. Well-designed APIs enable seamless integrations, support scaling, and create delightful developer experiences. This guide covers best practices for building production-ready APIs.

## API Design Principles

### 1. RESTful Resource Modeling
Design around resources, not actions:
- **Nouns, not verbs**: \`/users\` not \`/getUsers\`
- **HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- **Hierarchy**: \`/users/:id/orders\` for nested resources
- **Consistency**: Predictable patterns across endpoints

### 2. Versioning Strategy
Plan for change from day one:
- **URL versioning**: \`/v1/users\`, \`/v2/users\`
- **Header versioning**: \`Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1\`
- **Backward compatibility**: Support older versions
- **Deprecation policy**: Clear migration timelines

### 3. Error Handling
Provide actionable error responses:
- **HTTP status codes**: Use correctly (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- **Error messages**: Clear, actionable descriptions
- **Error codes**: Machine-readable identifiers
- **Validation errors**: Field-level details

### 4. Documentation
Make your API easy to discover and use:
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Standard specification
- **Examples**: Request/response samples
- **Authentication**: Clear auth instructions
- **Rate limits**: Usage constraints
- **Changelog**: Version history

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication
- **JWT tokens**: Stateless authentication
- **OAuth 2.0**: Delegated authorization
- **API keys**: Simple identification
- **Refresh tokens**: Long-lived sessions

### Authorization
- **Role-based access**: Permissions by role
- **Resource-level**: Fine-grained control
- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal necessary access

### Data Protection
- **HTTPS only**: Encrypt in transit
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **XSS protection**: Escape outputs
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **HTTP caching**: ETags, Cache-Control headers
- **Application caching**: Redis, Memcached
- **CDN**: Static content delivery
- **Database caching**: Query result caching

### Pagination
Handle large datasets efficiently:
- **Cursor-based**: Scalable pagination
- **Offset-based**: Simple implementation
- **Limit controls**: Maximum page size
- **Total count**: Optional (expensive)

### Filtering and Sorting
Enable flexible querying:
- **Query parameters**: \`?status=active&sort=-createdAt\`
- **Field selection**: \`?fields=id,name,email\`
- **Search**: \`?q=keyword\`
- **Complex filters**: JSON-based query language

## API Patterns

### 1. RESTful CRUD
Standard resource operations:
\`\`\`
GET    /users          # List users
GET    /users/:id      # Get user
POST   /users          # Create user
PUT    /users/:id      # Update user (full)
PATCH  /users/:id      # Update user (partial)
DELETE /users/:id      # Delete user
\`\`\`

### 2. Bulk Operations
Efficient batch processing:
\`\`\`
POST   /users/batch    # Create multiple
PATCH  /users/batch    # Update multiple
DELETE /users/batch    # Delete multiple
\`\`\`

### 3. Nested Resources
Related entities:
\`\`\`
GET    /users/:id/orders
POST   /users/:id/orders
GET    /users/:id/orders/:orderId
\`\`\`

### 4. Webhooks
Push notifications:
- Event-driven updates
- Retry logic
- Signature verification
- Idempotency

## Testing APIs

### Unit Tests
