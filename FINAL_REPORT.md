## Design Philosophy

### Visual Identity

**Logo-Derived Design System**
- Primary Colors: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a), graphite (#2d2d2d)
- Accent: Electric violet (#8b5cf6 → #6366f1 gradient)
- Typography: Inter (headings/body) + JetBrains Mono (metrics/code)
- Aesthetic: Executive minimalism meets high-tech elegance

### Design Principles

1. **Results-Focused Content**: Every section emphasizes measurable outcomes
2. **Generous Spacing**: Confident, uncluttered layouts
3. **Cinematic Motion**: Scroll-triggered animations with natural easing
4. **Typography Hierarchy**: Clear scale (4xl → 8xl for impact)
5. **Responsive Excellence**: Mobile-first, thoughtful breakpoints
6. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1+ compliance throughout

### Inspiration & Differentiation

**Studied**: Framer, Locomotive, Clay, Stripe, Superlist
**Differentiated By**:
- Unique violet-graphite color palette from logo
- Business-outcome focus (not just features)
- Metric-driven storytelling with animated counters
- Deeper technical content in blog and case studies
